\section{Introduction}
Since 1984, each year, motivated students from Munich, Erlangen and Stuttgart gather in a hidden valley far away at the Ferienakademie in Sarntal. While in the beginning it started with only three courses, we are currently looking at an offer of twelve courses students can apply for. But not only the number of possible choices has increased, also the program and activities themselves have evolved over the years. 

In this paper, we want to look at the reason why talented students are willing to give up their well-earned holidays to lock themselves up in Southern Tyrol. What are the reasons for the great success of Ferienakademie and why you should definitely go there. Of course, as it should be in a research paper, this is based on objective studies, observations and research.

For doing so, we look at the different methods used to attract gifted students, at their application and finally at the conclusion.
