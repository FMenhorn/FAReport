\subsection{Pre-Processing}

The input image undergoes the following sequence of filters:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Flip image}: 
	
	\verb|img = img::flip(img, true, false);|
	
	Flipping the image along the y-axis is necessary because the coordinate system of a standard image has its origin on the top-left corner, while standard fluid codes begin indexing from the bottom-left corner.

	\item \textit{Gaussian filter and opening}

	\verb|blurred = img::gaussianFilter(img, 7, 2);|

	\verb|opened = img::opening(blurred, structuringElement, 2);|
	
	The gaussian filter and opening helps eliminates fuzzy borders of adjacent colors, making them sharper.

	\item \textit{Thresholding}

	\verb|thresholded = applyThresholding(opened);|
	
	Thresholding applies yes-no filters on the image based on the colors of different domain types.

\end{enumerate}
