\section{Introduction}
This is a framework for interactive simulation and visualization of
steered computational fluid and rigid body simulations.
It is based on pipelining concept further explained in Sec.\,\ref{sec:pipeline}
and a modular communication infrastructure.

This document gives an introduction to the basic concepts of the framework and
describes the requirements of it.
