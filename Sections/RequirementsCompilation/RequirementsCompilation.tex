\section{Requirements \& Compilation}

The project was developed to be compiled and executed on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
\footnote{\url{http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop}}.

After downloading and installing the system, several packages are required.
Those can be installed using \textit{apt-get} from the command line.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libv4l-dev g++
$ apt-get install git
$ apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev libcv2.4 libhighgui2.4 libcvaux2.4 opencv-doc
$ apt-get install cmake freeglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev doxygen graphviz mono-complete git-core
$ apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libarpack2-dev
$ apt-get install valgrind
\end{lstlisting}

If you have an NVIDIA-GPU and want to use it, you should install CUDA as well. To do this, 
first install the latest proprietary driver via the "Additional Drivers" Tool in Ubuntu.
Then, follow the instructions of this \href{www.r-tutor.com/gpu-computing/cuda-installation/cuda7.0-ubuntu}{How-To} 
(but use the stuff for ubuntu 14.10 - there's no .deb-package for Ubuntu 15.04 yet,
but this one works just fine)

For eclipse development environment, additionally install java jre
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ apt-get install default-jre
\end{lstlisting}

After installation of the required packages, the code can be compiled with

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ make
\end{lstlisting}

In case that you get any compilation errors, please send your advisors an
email. The program will be located in the build folder and can be run by

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
$ ./build/fa_2014_release
\end{lstlisting}
