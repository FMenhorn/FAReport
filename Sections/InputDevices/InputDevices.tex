In order to install the sources for Kinect \& Wii integration, take a look at the folders \emph{sources-for-kinect} and \emph{sources-for-wii}. Please read the corresponding README files inside and do what it says.

\begin{itemize}
\item we only used kinect
\item shortly describe kinect input gestures and necessary steps to get the rowing movement detected and correctly resolved
\item what do we do with the input? Forward it to rigid bodies!
\end{itemize}
